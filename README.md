Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Layoffs Dataset

 📌 Project Overview
This project explores global layoff trends using SQL.  
The dataset (`layoffs_staging2`) was analyzed to uncover patterns across companies, industries, countries, and years.

🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Identified companies with 100% layoffs (complete shutdowns).
- Analyzed funding levels of failed companies (e.g., BritishVolt raised $2B before collapse).
- Determined industries, countries, and company stages most impacted by layoffs.
- Tracked layoffs across years and months, including rolling totals.
- Extracted top 5 companies with the highest layoffs per year.

📂 Files
- `Exploratory Data Analysis.sql` → SQL queries for EDA.

📊 Next Steps
- Visualize findings using Power BI / Tableau / Python.
- Extend analysis with predictive modeling for layoff trends.
